## GENESIS 1:1-31

1. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
2. And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face
   of the waters.
3. And God said, let there be light: and there was light.
4. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 5.And God called the light Day, and the
   darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
